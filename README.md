## Overview
FlowR2A is a multimodal driving planner that learns the reward-conditioned action distribution *p(a | r)* with flow matching. Instead of treating simulation rewards as discriminative targets, FlowR2A treats them as a *condition*, unifying the dense supervision of scoring-based methods with the generative proposal modeling of anchor-based methods. At inference, generation is steered toward high-reward trajectories via classifier-free guidance.

## Qualitative Results on NAVSIM
Each row is one planner; trajectory proposals are colored by PDM score, from <b>red&nbsp;(0)</b> to <b>green&nbsp;(1)</b>. FlowR2A (bottom row) produces proposals that are both diverse and consistently high-scoring.
